## 323. Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph

- <https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-connected-components-in-an-undirected-graph/>
- <https://neetcode.io/problems/count-connected-components>

There is an undirected graph with n nodes. There is also an edges array, where `edges[i] = [a, b]` means that there is an edge between node a and node b in the graph.

Return the total number of connected components in that graph.

Example 1:

```txt
Input:
n=3
edges=[[0,1], [0,2]]

Output:
1
```

Example 2:

```txt
Input:
n=6
edges=[[0,1], [1,2], [2,3], [4,5]]

Output:
2
```

Constraints:

- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `0 <= edges.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2`
